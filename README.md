RETRO THEME QUIZ GAME!!
A timed quiz. Click a button to begin, everytime a question is answered wrong time is subtracted. The game is over when either all questions are answered or the timer runs out. If you score high enough you can add your initials at the end.
NOTES:
when adding score on high score page, I did not add persistence to display previous scores from localStorage because the assignment did not specify that as a require ment
